=============

Scraper for Blingee stamps, which are PNG animations stored as SWFs.

PNGs can be extracted from the SWFs using the included tool swf2png.js, which requires `swfextract`, part of [swftools](http://wiki.swftools.org/wiki/Main_Page).  Special thanx to timb for this.

Much thanks to [blingscience](http://blingeescience.tumblr.com/) for revealing the beauty of Blingee.
